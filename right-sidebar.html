												<h3>Rocket Simulation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project involved creating a resource management simulation in C, demonstrating advanced understanding of memory handling, multithreading, 
												and data synchronization. The simulation dynamically managed memory using malloc and free, ensuring efficient allocation and proper cleanup to 
												prevent memory leaks and optimize performance. Multithreading was implemented to enable concurrent execution of multiple tasks, improving the 
												responsiveness and throughput of the simulation. Synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, were utilized to manage access to shared 
												resources, ensuring thread-safe operations and eliminating race conditions.
											</p>
											<p>
												By carefully designing and testing the application, a robust and scalable simulation environment was created 
												that maintained stability under varying conditions. This project emphasizes the ability to handle 
												complex programming challenges, including memory optimization and the coordination of parallel processes.

												<h3>Zentrition (In development)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This is a comprehensive mobile application designed to assist users with smarter grocery management and food waste reduction. It is being developed using 
												Flutter to make the app compatible with both Android and iOS platforms, offering a seamless and responsive user experience. Users can scan grocery 
												barcodes to upload item details into their personal profiles, automating the process of tracking inventory. The app leverages an AI/ML model 
												built with PyTorch to analyze the user's inventory and recommend recipes tailored to their available ingredients and upcoming expiration dates,
												 functioning as a personal nutrition assistant.
											</p>
											<p>
												Additionally, the app allows users to mark items as used or wasted, providing insights into 
												 usage habits and encouraging more sustainable food practices. This project showcases skills in cross-platform development, AI/ML 
												 integration, and user-centric design, creating a practical tool that combines convenience with environmental consciousness.
